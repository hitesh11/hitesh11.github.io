Applying deep learning approaches to make predictions on intergalactic medium characteristics such as the density of neutral hydrogen in dense regions of the universe which are not observable directly. Designed a CNN based architecture to predict optical depth from noisy observations of observed flux from the simulation spectra of Lyman-α forest and achieved promising results.
