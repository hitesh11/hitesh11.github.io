Advised by [Prof. Asim Smailagic](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./asim/) Designed semi-supervised deep learning pipeline for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection using retinal fundus images based on a combined auto-encoder and classifier network architecture. Extended the [GradNorm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02257.pdf) algorithm to handle dynamic tuning of gradient magnitudes of multiple losses in semi-supervised multi-task settings, where some of the losses may not be present for all data samples. Achieved an improvement of 2% on ResNet18 baseline on the Messidor DR dataset.
