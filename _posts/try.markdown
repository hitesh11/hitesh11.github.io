Designed semi-supervised deep learning pipeline for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection using retinal fundus images based on a combined auto-encoder and classifier network architecture. Extended the GradNorm algorithm to handle dynamic tuning of gradient magnitudes of multiple losses in semi-supervised multi-task settings, where some of the losses may not be present for all data samples. Achieved an improvement of 2% on ResNet18 baseline on the Messidor DR dataset.
