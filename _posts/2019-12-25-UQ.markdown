I worked with Prof. Scott Beatson to design an algorithm for classifying a bacterial sequence as either a chromosome or plasmid, which forms an important part of antibiotics research. We initially developed rule-based methods for classification based on the alignment distance from reference genomes. To improve results further, we applied machine learning methods of Hidden Markov Model, Support Vector Machine and Neural networks achieving accuracy of 67.7%, 82% and 87.6% respectively.
