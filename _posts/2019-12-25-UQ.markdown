I designed a software pipeline to classify a bacterial sequence as either a chromosome or a plasmid using the method of filtering based on optimal sequence alignment using BLAST. This helped to classify a substantial number of plasmids, however, there were still a considerable number of false positives. So I started exploring machine learning-based approaches for better classification. This triggered my interest in learning more about pattern recognition methods as part of my Artificial Intelligence course project, where I continued working on this problem to obtain a high classification accuracy by applying the machine learning models of HMM, SVM and Neural networks.
