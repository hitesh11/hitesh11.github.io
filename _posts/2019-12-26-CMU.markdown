In summer 2013, I was selected for the Research Experience for Undergraduates Program at CMU where I worked with Prof. Onur Mutlu on improving the state-of-the-art algorithm for DNA sequence mapping. In this work, we designed an optimal algorithm for hash-based mappers based on the idea of heterogeneous seeds and achieved ~15X reduction in mapping cost, while increasing memory usage by only ~1.5% compared to state-of-the-art mappers like mrFAST. Our paper on this work, unfortunately, didnâ€™t get accepted as similar research was published around the same time and it taught me about the more humble side of research.
