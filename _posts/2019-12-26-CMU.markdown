I worked with Prof. Onur Mutlu on improving the state-of-the-art algorithm for DNA sequence mapping, which is a known critical bottleneck in genomic research. I worked closely with the PhD student Hongyi Xin and designed an optimal algorithm for hash-based mappers based on the idea of "heterogeneous seeds" and achieved ~15X reduction in mapping cost, while increasing memory usage by only ~1.5% compared to state-of-the-art short seed mappers like mrFAST. I continued working on the problem after returning to IIT and we submitted our work to APBC 2014. The paper, unfortunately, didnâ€™t get accepted as similar research was published around the same time and it taught me about the more humble side of research.
